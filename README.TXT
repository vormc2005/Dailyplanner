This daily planner represents a simple calendar application. The application is supposed to have following functions:
1. User should be able to save notes by typing them in the text area.
2. Calendar has timeslots from 9am to 5pm. 
3. Whennever user hits refresh, saved notes should show in corresponding textfield.
4. As time goes by any timeslots that have already past show in red color, while any text areas with future timeslots would show in green.

Unfrotunately, I was not abel to figure out how to make 2 things to work:
1. I could not make colors to change with timepassing.
2. I could not get get storage to upload informetion into correponding textfield.

I definetely would like to finish this application.
